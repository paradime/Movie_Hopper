MovieHopper!!
By Bryon Wilkins (BryonWilkins94@gmail.com)

Movie Hopper is a small tool for rapscallions who want to watch a bunch of 
screenings of movies but can't quite figure out the most optimal path to 
maximize their movie watching experience!

Movie Hopper should be used for film festivals where the amount of movies you'd
like to see is unlimited and you want to cram in as many as possible.

Run the program via command line: python3 C://filepath/movieHopper.py
Then follow on screen instructions being sure to follow all formatting standards
Movie Hopper should output a list of movies in ascending order(based on time) 
Go see the movies in that order!

For developers:
use inp.x for stdin testing purposes
